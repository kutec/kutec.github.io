For the purpose, I had to create a quick demo that can be accessible to client so that they can review and provide feedback instantly.\nI am frequent user of Cloud 9 IDE.\nWhat is Cloud9/C9 IDE C9 is a cloud based code editor and everything you need for development purpose. It also allows code to be synced from Github and Bitbucket. I love WordPress and found C9 very handy for demonstrating purpose. You can save numbers of FREE/PUBLIC projects online and can run from anywhere and though any device. I am personally very big fan of C9.\nUsing Cloud9 for @Angular/CLI Node Version Issue C9 has Nodejs 4.x by default installed and that\u0026rsquo;s using NVM. I am not much familiar with NVM as I download Nodejs from official Nodejs site to install it in my PC but NVM provides easy way to switch between different Nodejs versions.\n@Angular/cli required Node 6.9.0 or higher. So it gave error while tried to run ng serve.\nI looked around into the IDE configuration and preferences but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any solution. Then I found very simple way to upgrade NVM to the latest version. I eagerly ran below command and that made my life easy :)\nnvm install 6.11.0  Now ng command can be accessed inside Cloud9 IDE.\nNote: You need to run above command each time you open a project from C9 Dashboard.\nCloud 9 IDE V/s Localhost Could 9 is a web based IDE, which has it\u0026rsquo;s own IP address. That obviosuly doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand localhost:8080.\nI tried out many ways but the simplest one is to update package.json. Replace,\n\u0026quot;scripts\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;start\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ng serve\u0026quot;, },  with\u0026hellip;\n\u0026quot;scripts\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;start\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --public $C9_HOSTNAME\u0026quot;, },  You might have noticed --public $C9_HOSTNAME. This is to avoid invalid host error.\nWith all above configuration, your project is good to run.\nTo run your app and preview in browser do as directed in below screenshot.

However, it will be hidden the element using angular class in case of false condition.\nIn simple words, the element, where the ng-show has been declared over that will be available on a web page (including its child elements) and can be seen by removing angular specific class that hides them.\n\nngIf (or ng-if) As mentioned above, ng-if works in similar fashion but with little difference. ng-if doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate the element on which the condition ng-if has applied. That means, it will be removed the element completely from the DOM tree structure, if condition is not matched.\nWhy using ng-if is better than ng-show? If you have used ng-show in your code, where you have \u0026lt;img src='path-to-image' /\u0026gt; defined as a child element and that is unfortunately having wrong path, you might get 404 error, even though the logical condition is false. The only reason is that the browser would scan the whole page available as DOM and so the elements inside ng-show DIV/P.\nOn the other hand, ng-if will be removed the DOM from the tree structure and hence we could fix a bug of getting 404 error. 404 error is a status error, if resource is NOT FOUND.\nBelow, I have put a JSFIDDLE example to get a better idea:\n Have a great coding and put your comments below for any discussion/confusion.\nThanks :)\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"47e60fc33d9fc89df8f553364aec6e56","tags":["AngularJS","JS"],"title":"AngularJS - ngIf Vs. ngShow","type":"code","url":"/code/angularjs-ngif-vs-ngshow/"},{"author":"","categories":["Namespace","JS"],"content":"\nI was working on a small jQuery plugin, where I wanted to define a common jQuery function to be used multiple times as per requirement.

It was c-section, so there was mix feeling of excitement and fear!\n All of a sudden, nurse came out with a smiling face from OT (Operation Theater) and put a small baby over my arms. I literally cried at that moment and that was one of the best feeling, can\u0026rsquo;t be explained in words :)\n It was the auspicious day of the Rakhi (August 18, 2016), we blessed with a baby boy. A true blessing for me, my wife Kinjal and the whole family.\n Everything was smooth, happy and exciting!\nAs a part of a regular process, all the nursing home called external pediatric expert to check whether a baby is normal or not. The same happened in my case too. The pediatrician was Dr. Rajesh K. Parikh from MATRUCHHAYA CHILDREN HOSPITAL \u0026amp; SURGICAL NURSING HOME. As parents, we usually put our trust if someone recommended by the main doctor and we did the same. We decided to continue with the same pediatrician suggested by Dr. Kanan Vyas (who operated the delivery of my wife).\n\n Post delivery, Dr. Parikh checked my baby and said that everything is normal and nothing to worry about. But I and my mother-in-law observed blackish lips of a baby at the same time while Dr. Parikh was observing the child for the very first time. But he said the color tone of a baby is little darker and baby\u0026rsquo;s hemoglobin is stronger enough to get that darkness. We also noticed that baby become even darker while crying and show our concern to Dr. Parikh after a week, while visited his clinic for the 1st vaccination round. But he answered stereotype. So we thought that might be the only reason. And a baby is perfectly well.\nAfter 1.5 months, we had an appointment for the 2nd vaccination round. Even though we took an appointment and waiting for approx 2 hours in a heavy crowded room with a month little baby of just 1.5 months, instead of giving priority to us (or other parents), Mr. Parikh called MR (Marketing Representative) in his cabin for a discussion. My wife and mother-in-law requested few times at the reception to give priority to us as our baby was crying. But instead of asking doctor, receptionist ask us to check with other patients (that was really weird feeling, I mean why should we beg to the people!! anyways\u0026hellip;), but nothing happened and finally, mother-in-law decided to leave from there and consult with another pediatrician who respects parents and their time.\nOn the next day, we took an appointment with Dr. Malav shah and Dr.Kiran shah. On the very first sitting of a vaccination, they observed crying baby with dark body tone and told us to wait until a baby is quiet enough for vaccination. Meanwhile, they kept asking few relevant questions and we answered.\nAfter thorough observation, he suggested us to do a quick echo report just to confirm why baby become so blackish while crying and with no time we left for echo test to Dr. Vishal Chngela (pediatric cardiologist) and unfortunately the report was positive.\nMy son found with a major heart defect which is called d-TGA (dextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextro-Transposition_of_the_great_arteries).\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:D-tga-575px.jpg\nHe was just 1.5 months old and we have never noticed anything wrong except the darker color body tone of lips and the face while crying. It was something shocking for us as none of the family side we have major heart diseases to anyone.\nDr. Changela told that such a defect identified during 4d anatomy scan in most of cases. I also googled a bit and found, this can be identified during 18th-week anatomy scan but in our case, unfortunately, it couldn\u0026rsquo;t. We can say that this is because of the improper attitude of doctors who did scan and generated reports, Dr. Rajesh who didn\u0026rsquo;t suggest even an echo report just to confirm, and Dr. Kanan Vyas who noticed less oxygen after delivery but yet not suggested to do a report.\nAs suggested by Dr. Changela and Malav, we took a quick step to admit our 1.5 months old baby to the hospital, U. N. Mehta in the emergency ward.\nMy son Jash was in the hospital from 6th October 2016 to 8th November 2016. He has been operated with a minor lung surgery on 9th October 2016 and major open heart surgery on 12th October 2016. All these happened within a week time period.\nOn October 19, 2016, we came to know his condition is critical as he caught by infection SEPSIS (or SEPTICEMIA) is kind of a blood infection which is a serious medical condition.\nRead more about Sepsis infection: http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sepsis-septicemia-blood-infection\nOctober 25, 2016 - Due to infection, his BP is constantly low down and we had to inject blood platelets too. But till the date, there is no improvement. We have to wait and watch.\nOctober 28, 2016 (Friday) Today we came to know that Jash\u0026rsquo;s condition is the worst and we need a Single Platelet Donor (SPD).\nI am so thankful to people in my current company (CIGNEX Datamatics) where HR and all are so good as a helping hand to find such a donor. Heartly appreciate the warm behavior from the company.\nI would not forget to mention the whole UI team including\u0026hellip; - Tapan Chitroda and Family - Manish Sharma (who infect was an SPD)\nNovember 2, 2016 (Wednesday) Finally, Jash\u0026rsquo;s condition is well and infection report is now so negative. We took a breath of relief\u0026hellip; And on the next day, he had been moved from pediatric ICU to the physiotherapist ward.\nAnd here the day comes:\nThanks for reading and supporting.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"4d17c06fda44ff5d9813562f10d894ea","tags":["Life Event","Sad"],"title":"My Son Had to Pass Through Open Heart Surgery","type":"journal","url":"/journal/jash-fighting-with-a-birth-defect/"},{"author":"","categories":["Update"],"content":"You might be aware about my tech blog.

In the local everything works great without any malfunctioning but on production I was getting upload media error.\n I could click on the “Add Media” button (above the visual editor section) but when clicking on “Select Files” or dropped files there, nothing was happening! It was Tiny MCE script error in Chrome console, but not sure from which plugin it was…  What I Did  I first took backup of the entire site (including the database) Then I renamed the current theme folder name to see whether it’s issue from my theme or not. WordPress enables default theme if it didn’t get currently activated theme in the theme folder. So I tried that and upload was working. So it might be theme issue but yet we cannot say firmly. Hold on… Then I again renamed the theme folder to it’s previously given name and appied it again. Later on, I started disabling all the plugins which were adding functionality to the control/admin panel. But yet upload didn’t work. Finally I decided to disable all the plugins at once and check. Surprisingly the upload functionality started working. So that’s confirmed now that this is no more theme related issue from my code. After that I started activating plugin one-by-one which infect helped me to find a root cuase of the issue.  The issue was coming from Tiny MCE script of Jetpack plugin.

Initially it was planned for Panchmadhi but due to pregnancy of one of the member (Pooja Mehta - brother-in-law\u0026rsquo;s wife) in the family, we changed the plan to Ujjain. Because of heavy rush we couldn\u0026rsquo;t get reservation and had to take Tatkal tickets.\nWell! this trips was with my in-laws, including my wife (Kinjal Jayswal) of course:) and I really enjoyed it but we had to passed through some really bad situations too. Hats off to Indian Railway and uncle Viresh (travel agent).\nThe Start The day November 9, 2015, we left around 7:30 PM (IST) for the Kalupur railway station to catch the train. The only tarin available was the Sabarmati Express, which takes to long way to Varanasi, starting from Ahmedabad.\nThe boggy was quiet full with people travelling to their native place Varanasi / Lukhnaw, etc. to meet their family (once in a year) and celebrate the Diwali festival. Usually Diwali is the bigest festival in India and IRCTC must take care by adding extra boggies to avoid extra crowd. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why the tickets has been sold even after the full. This is really rediculous, there was no meaning of the reservation. The compartment was open for everyone to come in and join the already overcrowded boggy.\nIf men are traveling alone then it can be managed sometime but reservation is preferable while we travel with family, with elder ladies. People were flying over the crowd with support of rodes like a Spiderman. But this situation is the worst in the country for women. And as the train gooes to longer way there was no chance that some people might left the train at some destination as most of the people from crowd travelling to Varanasi or Lucknow. Our destination was Ujjain and ladies has to suffer 8-9 hours in this overcrowded boggy.\nAfter all this I learnt not to plan a trip during Diwali or if you had to then plan properly well in advance.\nThe First Day November 10, 2015, the very first day at Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh). It was aroud 7:30 AM we reached out here.\nThe Parrot Tree PC This was the attraction at the Ujjain railway station. The tree with lot of parrots on it. Infect, parrots seems like leaves of the tree and you would only realize that these are parrot birds and not the leaves, when they fly out. Really nature has many hidden magic like this, just awesome!\nWe have a in-laws family relative over there in Ujjain. After reaching to his home, we took bath and relaxed for few hours as we all tiered by long restless journey.\nIscon Temple, Ujjain In the evening we planned to see nearby palces. One of them was Iscon temple. It was quiet good and peaceful. We enjoyed some sweet dishes there. So delicious!! \nThe Mahakal Temple  Actually the Ujjain is famous for its temples. So it's not like that I am fond of going temples only. Infect I hate that. But there is not much spaces in Ujjain to go. The next day we tried to go to very popular **Mahakal Temple** but unfortunately it was overcrowded and it couldn't happened. We tried the same way for 3 times. But really, people has made that religiois space like a commercial hub. If you go there, you would find 2 different queues. One for general (which usually longer one, endless). You need to spend 2-3 hour normally to see the lord Shiva. Second is the VIP queue, where you can spend Rs.150-200 per individual and join the shorter queue. In my opinion, this is something deviding people's thought to the worst side. The people who can spen money can be allowed to see the god first!!! Poor Indian mentality! Isn't it??? I am strictly against it. FYI, Mahakal is one of the Jyotirlinga, so possibility there many people around the world come to complete their religious vow. And most of people who believes in such mentality are below the middle class level. So they have to wait long hours. One more thing, to visit the temple, we need to keep all our belongings outside of the temple in a safe locker. Including our mobile and wallet. Why? For mobile, it make some sense but today no girl is safe without mobile. This should not be encouraged more. I am HINDU and I am religious too, not against to our culture. But I don't like fake people and useless or logicless beliefs and \"have to do\" kind of things. Likewise Mahakal temple, I have seen the same thing at many places. The Girnar montain also has the same tradition for Guru Dattatrey temple, people forced to contribute money in a temple to see the god. If you do so then only you can go ahead in the queue or else you cannot see the god even after climbing up to this much height. So there are many negative things we have to bare in India. The only tagline \"I LOVE MY INDIA\" is not the all. We should really mean it in positive manner. Too much frustation... Leave it! **INTERESTING FACT**: Temple's \"Poojari\" _(a dedicated person who take care of temple's timings and other devotional activities)_ is one of the richest person of the Ujjain, he owned a 2-3 floor bunglow with a elevator :). How? That you have to think!!! ## The Movie Time, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo 3rd day we planned for a movie - Prem Ratan Dhan Payo as per family demand. I don't like the movie anyway. But I was happy that I had to spend very less amount on the movie ticket than Ahmedabad.  The Food and Usual Days I love one thing. People are very engergatic, no tiredness at all. I went for a day with Chhoti along with Kinjal and really enjoyed. Ujjain is a small city and they closed down some roads in the morning for jogging, sketting and other children activities. I also like the big gardens. And most important, it\u0026rsquo;s polutionless. So neat and clean air!!!\nI am from Ahmedabad. Ahmedabadis are generally foody and here food is too costly. In Ujjain we can get dilicisious food at very very low spend. But again it\u0026rsquo;s hygienic enough to eat.\nAs I visited Ujjain last Diwali, I forgot some of the things and I would update if it strike my mind in the future.\nLastly, I would like to thank Manishbhai, Payalbhabhi, Bhavi, Dixa and all family members for their hospitality and love. Speicially to Bhahiji for dilicious food.\nThank you very much for standing by and reading this long story.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"a018ba9e002bbe81f4a9f86bb0212899","tags":["Family Time","Ujjain","Holidays","2015"],"title":"Spent Diwali 2015 at Ujjain","type":"journal","url":"/journal/diwali-2015-at-ujjain/"},{"author":"","categories":["WordPress","Angular","RESTful","API"],"content":"This project is a online tool, where you can compare various JavaScript frameworks.
