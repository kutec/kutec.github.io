Hello :)

Thanks for landing by my personal site.

I am Kushal Jayswal and [this page](/about) would give the information about me, as a person in personal & professional life.

## I am Inspired by the **Music**
TL;DR I am a peaceful person by nature and truely inspired by music. I used to compose and remix tracks in my college days. You can find some of copositions and music taste  on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/kjayz "Soundcloud.com"). Below is my all time favourite coposition.

When I talk about music, I never forget 3 people, who keeps me inspired all the time:
1. [Ronak R.](https://soundcloud.com/rokzroom "Soundcloud")
2. [A. R. Rahman](https://soundcloud.com/arrahman "Official Website")
3. [Yaani](http://www.yanni.com/ "Official Website")


## Academics
I always wanted to be a creative person in my life. But due to some family priorities, I couldn't follow my 1st dream of being a _music composer_. Finally, I added **Master in Computer Applications (MCA)** in 2011 from Gujarat University followed by **Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.)** in 2007 again from Gujarat University.

## Professional
But still I was attached with the "creativity". Visual things atrracted me more in those cool days. I decided to move into **Web Design** field rather than to _core development_. I worked with many big brands as a _freelance UI expert_.

After some years, I decided to see my luck in full-time job. Today, I am working with a raputed company in India as a UI Consultant. It has been around **4 years** doing full-time and I got overall **8 years of experience** working as a Web Designer, Frontend Developer, WordPress, Liferay and Magento Theme Developer. I am also comfortable with Photoshop. _(I will update my CV on this site soon.)_

## Personal Life
I leave with my wife in India. I got married after 6 years of long relationship with a smart and beatiful lady of my life - **Kinjal Mehta**. The _January 29, 2012_ was a lucky day, when I officially announced as a husband (blushing)! In 2016, we have completed 10 years in a single boat. I really love her a lot and cannot expect my life without her.

Talking about my family, I am lucky to have a younger brother - **Deval Jayswal**, who is wonderful photographer by passion and professionaly too. He also has completed _M.Sc.IT & BCA_ as academics but he is more crazy than me! You can visit his [portfolio website](http://devaljayswal.com "Deval Jayswal - Portfolio Website") and get the idea of his work. He does all kind of photography like wedding, pre-wedding, maternity, candid, etc. but his main focus is in the nature, abstarct, astro and many more wiered photgraphy that even I (personally) cannot think of :).

My parents are very caring and sweet. My mother - **Dixita Jayswal** is a smart home maker with great speciality of dilicious food. My father - **Sunil Jayswal** is working as a Financial Advisor and connected with LIC, GIC like companies from last 27 years. You should [contact him](tel:+919898519319 "+919898519319 (Mobile)") if you need an investment planner to save some tax.

## About This Site
[This site](http://kjayz.com) will always be under development because I use to update the code & design timely.
[KJAYZ.com](http://kjayz.com) is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is static page generator that means it doen't require a database to maintain dynamic pages and posts. Initially I had a plan to develop the same on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) but I already have a nice [tech blog](http://teckstack.com) developed on WordPress, so I learned new way to create a fully dynamic site without much hussle.
